### Overview

The project folder includes: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model generated by model.py)
* track1.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track)

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to use  Nvidia's CNN for Self-driving car.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting and the car stock on the eage of the rode. After I turn to implment more complex Nvidia's CNN, the situatio turns better.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I record more training datas in these spots and train the 

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

The network consists of 9 layers, including a normalization layer, 5 convolutional layers, and 3 fully-connected layers. The first layer accepts an rgb image of size 66x200x3 and performs image normalization, resulting in features ranging from values -1.0 to 1.0. The first convolutional layer accepts input of 3&#64;66x200, has a filter of size 5x5 and stride of 2x2, resulting in output of 24&#64;31x98. The second convolutional layer then applies a filter of size 5x5 with stride of 2x2, resulting in and output of 36&#64;14x47. The third convolutional layer then applies a filter of size 5x5 with stride of 2x2, resulting in output of 48&#64;5x22. The fourth convolutional layer applies a filter of 3x3 with stride of 1x1 (no stride), resulting in output of 64&#64;3x20. The fifth and final convolutional layer then applies a filter of 3x3 with no stride, resulting in output of 64&#64;1x18. The output is then flattened to produce a layer of 1164 neurons. The first fully-connected layer then results in output of 100 neurons, followed by 50 neurons, 10 neurons, and finally produces an output representing the steering angle. A detailed image and summary of the network can be found below. I use dropout after each layer with drop probabilities ranging from 0.1 after the first convolutional layer to 0.5 after the final fully-connected layer. In addition, I use l2 weight regularization of 0.001. The activation function used is the exponential linear unit (ELU), and an adaptive learning rate is used via the Adam optimizer. The weights of the network are trained to minimize the mean squared error between the steering command output by the network and the steering angles of the images from the sample dataset. This architecture contains about 27 million connections and 252 thousand parameters.

#### 3. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model was trained and validated on several data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting. In an effort to reduce overfitting and increase my model's ability to generalize for driving on unseen roads, I artificially increased my dataset using a couple of proven image augmentation techniques. One method I used was randomly adjusting the brightness of the images. This is done by converting the image to HSV color space, scaling up or down the V channel by a random factor, and converting the image back to RGB. Another technique I used was flipping the image about the vertical axis and negating the steering angle. The idea here is to attempt to get an equal number of left and right steering angles in the training data to reduce any possible bias of left turns vs right turns or vice versa. The original size of each image is 160x320. I crop the top 40 pixels and the bottom 20 pixels from each image in order to remove any noise from the sky or trees in the top of the images and the car's hood from the bottom of the image. This results in image sizes of 100x320, which I then resize to 66x200, which is the input size of the neural network.

#### 4. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.

#### 5. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road. After that, I have same amount of left and right turn training samples

#### 6. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image1]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image4]
![alt text][image5]

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 25% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 5, since after 5 epoches, the validation error will never decrease. The batch size I choose is 128. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
After the draft before, I seperate the code into more OOP style functions and add generator.
