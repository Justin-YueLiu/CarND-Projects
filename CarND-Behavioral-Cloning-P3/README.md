* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model generated by model.py)
* track1.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track)

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

The network consists of 10 layers, including a normalization layer, a cropping layer, 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. (model.py line 62-72). The five convolutional layers follow with three fully connected layers leading to an output control value which is the inverse turning radius. The fully connected layers are designed to function as a controller for steering.

####2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model was trained and validated on several data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (model.py line 77).


####3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 78).

####4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road. After that, I have same amount of left and right turn training samples

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to use  Nvidia's CNN for Self-driving car.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting and the car stock on the eage of the rode. After I turn to implment more complex Nvidia's CNN, the situatio turns better.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I record more training datas in these spots and train the 

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

####2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes.



####3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image4]
![alt text][image5]

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 25%of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 5, since after 5 epoches, the validation error will never decrease. The batch size I choose is 128. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
